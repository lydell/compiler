# UNOFFICIAL ELM PACKAGE

**This is not the official `elm` npm package!**

This is a fork of the Elm _npm package._ It contains the _same binaries_ as the official package installs. The changes are:

- This package has no dependencies.
- This package also contains a binary for macOS ARM 64-bit, compiled by Evan. As of this writing (2023-09-30) that binary is available in the [official Elm 0.19.1 release](https://github.com/elm/compiler/releases/tag/0.19.1) but not in the `elm` npm package.
- This package also contains a binary for Linux ARM 64-bit, [compiled by Mario Rogic](https://github.com/supermario/elm-tooling-compiler/commit/3af7f31a0ad5c4c7fe6df51220b3ec3e1d62a643).

```
npm install @lydell/elm
```
