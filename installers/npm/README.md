# UNOFFICIAL ELM PACKAGE

**This is not the official `elm` npm package!**

This is a fork of the Elm _npm package._ It contains the _same binaries_ as the official package installs. The changes are:

- This package has no dependencies.
- This package also contains binaries for macOS ARM 64-bit and Linux ARM 64-bit, [compiled by Mario Rogic](https://github.com/supermario/elm-tooling-compiler/commit/3af7f31a0ad5c4c7fe6df51220b3ec3e1d62a643).
