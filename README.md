# UNOFFICIAL ELM PACKAGE

**This is not the official `elm` repository!**

This fork defaults to a branch with _no changes_ to the Elm compiler, _only to the npm package._

The npm package of this fork contains the _same binaries_ as the official package installs. The changes are:

- This package has no dependencies.
- This package also contains binaries for macOS ARM 64-bit and Linux ARM 64-bit, [compiled by Mario Rogic](https://github.com/supermario/elm-tooling-compiler/commit/3af7f31a0ad5c4c7fe6df51220b3ec3e1d62a643).
