# UNOFFICIAL ELM PACKAGE

**This is not the official `elm` repository!**

This fork defaults to a branch with _no changes_ to the Elm compiler, _only to the npm package._

The npm package of this fork contains the _same binaries_ as the official package installs â€“ plus a couple of new ones. Thatâ€™s the only point of this package.

- Linux ARM 64-bit (useful for example in Docker on macOS ARM), [compiled by Mario Rogic](https://github.com/supermario/elm-tooling-compiler/commit/3af7f31a0ad5c4c7fe6df51220b3ec3e1d62a643).
- Raspberry PI Linux ARM 32-bit, [compiled by dmy](https://github.com/dmy/elm-raspberry-pi).

```
npm install @lydell/elm
```

> **History:** This package was originally used for testing a better way to package Elm, which was then merged into the official `elm` package and released as version 0.19.1-6.
